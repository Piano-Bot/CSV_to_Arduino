# CSV_to_Arduino
Conversion Script to convert from the MIDI to CSV output into Arduino-readable input
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Implement a conversion system from .csv data to Arduino-actionable inputs
* Create hand path optimizations to improve the smoothness of playing
* Develop a deeper understanding of C++ programming
* Add on extensions that can be used to create simulations with graphics

## Project Overview

In the `src` folder, the files include:
* `main.cpp` - Create an instance of a song and calls high-level functions
* `Song.h` - Header for a Song object
* `Song.cpp` - Creates hand positions and states based on stored data and performs optimizations
* `Hand.h` - Header for a Hand object
* `Hand.cpp` - Stores data on the hand positions/states and provides information on an individual hand
